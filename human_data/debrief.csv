249,33307,246,32,During the first round I thought that initially there was some sort of pairing process that maybe the order of images were presented in played a part in  By the second round I realized that what was more likely was that there was some sort of value associated with each image so there was likely a comparison between the two and I was expected to choose the image with the higher value  I identified the highest and lowest images the foggy hazy blue one being the lowest and the other blue image with the four red dots on it being the highest  From there it was just a matter of trying to remember results of each in relation to one another  After repeating the process numerous times I was able to build a relatively decent map of each image and where the lie in relation to one another,Its probably taken into consideration already but I did become somewhat confused at points trying to select the correct image as the D key is further to the left so I would expect it to be associated it with the first image  Because of the speed of the exercise there were a few points I selected the wrong option because of the association of the images to keys on the keyboard,Right,Male,Second image,I put it in the previous response but basically it was trial and error initially but I figured out what was going on pretty quickly so from there it was just a matter of repetition until a map of the hierarchy of images was more solidified mentally,,,,,,,,,,250_Stims_1000_ISI,1,0.828,0.699300699300699
